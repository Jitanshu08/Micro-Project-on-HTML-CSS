# HTML & CSS Micro-Project

This micro-project demonstrates a simple HTML and CSS layout featuring responsive design techniques, Google Fonts integration, and styled components.

## Project Overview

The project consists of two main sections:

- **Upper Box**:

  - An inspiring design section that showcases a compelling message along with a registration form.
  - The upper box utilizes a background color defined using CSS variables (`--theme-color`).

- **Lower Box**:
  - A lower box section with grid-based layout (`grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr`) containing two columns (`left-aligned` and `right-aligned`).
  - The lower box has a contrasting background color defined using CSS variables (`--secondary-color`).

## Features

- **Google Fonts Integration**:

  - The project imports the 'Roboto' font family from Google Fonts using the `@import` rule in CSS.

- **Responsive Design**:

  - The layout is designed to be responsive and adapts to different screen sizes using percentage-based dimensions and flexbox/grid layout.

- **Interactive Button**:
  - The "Register Now" button (`#register-button`) has a hover effect implemented using CSS transitions (`transition: opacity 0.3s ease;`).
